**Sermon**

There are various kinds of wisdom. There is the wisdom that comes from
maths, which is formally provable. There is wisdom from science which is
evidence based but not generally formally provable. Then there is the
wisdom that comes from the arts which is not provable and is much more
to do with human behaviour and is meant to provoke thought and
discussion.

Then we have the wisdom that comes from religion, which is a kind of
refined and tested arts-type wisdom. This wisdom has survived hundreds
of years of human experience and been found to be solidly good advice.
All of these kinds of wisdom are natural, human wisdom -- and of course
they are all valuable.

Biblical wisdom is especially valuable and worth learning. Jesus made
much use of Biblical wisdom in his teaching and several times quoted or
used Proverbs. Our Gospel reading shows Jesus applying bible-wisdom in
answer to the question about inheriting eternal life.

But there were many times when Jesus seemed to ignore biblical wisdom
and do the opposite.

How about Prov 15:1

> **\"A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up
> anger.\"**

Do you think Jesus had this proverb in mind when he said

> **"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You
> are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on
> the inside are full of the bones of the dead and everything unclean.\"
> Matt 23:27**

or how about Prov 22:3:

> **\"The prudent man sees danger and hides himself, but the simple go
> on and suffer for it.\"**

Had Jesus forgotten that wise advice when he decided to go to Jerusalem:

> **\"From that time on Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he
> must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the
> elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and that he
> must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.\" Matt 16:21**

Here is another wise Proverb:

> **\"A fool's lips enter into contention, And his mouth calls for
> blows. A fool's mouth is his destruction, And his lips are the snare
> of his soul.\" Prov 18:6-7 NKJ**

Had Jesus never learned how practical this wisdom was as he was growing
up? But do you remember what happened when Jesus preached in Nazareth?

> **\"All spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that
> came from his lips. "Isn't this Joseph's son?" they asked.\" v22.**

They were all impressed and perfectly happy. But what does Jesus do? He
provokes them into outrage and they end up trying to throw Him off a
cliff!

> **\"All the people in the synagogue were furious when they heard this.
> They got up, drove him out of the town, and took him to the brow of
> the hill on which the town was built, in order to throw him off the
> cliff.\" v28-29**

According to all these biblical proverbs, Jesus was a fool! But only a
fool would say that Jesus was a fool!

There is another source of wisdom which trumps all the others. This
wisdom comes from the Holy Spirit. It is the kind of wisdom that Jesus
lived by and it is what Paul prays for the believers in Colossae.

> **We continually ask God to fill you with the knowledge of his will
> through all the wisdom and understanding that the Spirit gives\...**

This kind of wisdom overrides common sense, religious duties, keeping
out of other people\'s problems, worrying about what people might think.

Even in our Gospel reading there is a twist. Jesus\' answer about \"who
is my neighbour\" is more than an illustration about helping people in
need. He could easily have made the hero an ordinary Jewish citizen, but
Jesus deliberately cast the hero as a despised Samaritan and thereby
made his illustration deeply offensive. This is yet another case of
Jesus wilfully stirring up an argument.

So was Jesus simply a rude northerner? No doubt that is what the posh
southerner\'s thought, but Jesus claimed that he said what the Father
gave Him to say.

Wouldn\'t it be great if we could all say that truthfully? Jesus clearly
had a hot-line to God but what about the rest of us?

Jesus said that His sheep hear His voice and there are many promises
that God speaks to those who listen to Him. We too can have the wisdom
from the Holy Spirit, and that is what Paul prayed for, for the
believers in Colossae.

> **We continually ask God to fill you with the knowledge of his will
> through all the wisdom and understanding that the Spirit gives\...**

But God tends to speak in a still-small voice, quietly and gently into
our spirits. To hear Him we need to practice quietening our hearts and
listening for His voice. This not easy or popular in a world that is
frantic with activity. We can easily become lost in silence, so we
surround ourselves with music or speech. Everywhere you go it seems we
have to have background music, or the TV constantly on in the
background.

But allow yourself to imagine for a moment what it might be like to hear
God speak to you? It could be anything from a faint and uncertain
whisper to something that is unmistakably clear. He speaks in different
ways at different times -- but he promises to speak. Do you hear Jesus
speak to you? Is that something you would like? Would you like to hear
God\'s wisdom for you?

This is something we can all grow in. We can practice listening. When
you pray, try giving as much time to listening as you do to speaking.
God knows what you need before you pray. Perhaps God has some things He
would like to say to you? It could be anything from a hardly recognised
thought he wants to lodge in your mind for a future occasion, or a
gently growing awareness of something he wants to bring to your
attention, or it might be something he wants you to do or say. Sometimes
God speaks very clearly and you absolutely know it is Him -- perhaps a
word of encouragement, or an instruction or a correction.

When you read the bible, don\'t rush. Listen. Ask Jesus if he wants to
speak to you about anything through the passage. Try to develop a quiet
listening spirit. In time, if you practice and persist you will begin to
hear Him. You can practice listening with a friend, sitting in silence
and then asking each other what thoughts came to mind and discussing if
you think it might have been God speaking.

An ideal place to practice is in discipleship groups. What do you think
Jesus might want to say to you through the passage you have read, what
do you think Jesus might have been saying through the previous week,
what might Jesus be saying as you listen in prayer.

Jesus promised us wisdom from above, Paul prayed for wisdom from above
-- what about you and me? This is not just for adults. Children can
learn to hear God from a very early age, bringing them into a very
personal and real experience of God for themselves.

If we don\'t believe that we could hear God, or we think that God would
not want to speak to us, we will never practice listening. But if you do
believe that God is speaking and wants you to hear, then isn\'t this a
pearl of great price? Something worth investing in? Something worth
practicing?
