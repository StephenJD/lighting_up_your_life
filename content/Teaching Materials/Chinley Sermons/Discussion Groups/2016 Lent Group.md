# Life Attitudes

# Session Three -- Living Purposefully

## Brainstorm

What gives you satisfaction?

## Encounter

**Matthew 5:5-6**

"Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth."

"Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they
will be filled."

Thoughts on m*eekness*:

-   We have a problem of translation and changing meanings

-   Receiving rather than grabbing

-   God's agenda rather than ours

-   God's glory not ours

Thoughts on *inherit the earth*:

-   The '*earth'* may be a reference to the *promised land*

-   It seems likely that the meaning is the same at *the kingdom of God*
    in poetic balance with v1

Thoughts on *hunger and thirst for righteousness*:

-   Having God's priorities and values

-   Passionate longing for the world to be made whole

-   Acting on behalf of others in care and confrontation of evil

## Talk about it -- Group one

**"Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth." Mathew 5:5**

1.  How would you define meekness?

> Does meekness include being amiable and undemanding?
>
> What other words might we use?
>
> What is the difference with humility?Â 

2.  What did Jesus mean by \"inherit the earth?\" (See *"Thoughts on
    inherit the earth"* above*)*

> What other scriptures might help? e.g. Psalm 2:8, Daniel 7:27
>
> What examples could you give of a person \"inheriting the earth?\"

### Jesus Focus

In what ways did Jesus live out this beatitude? E.g. John 13:3-10

## Talk about it -- Group two

**Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they
will be filled. Mathew 5:6**

1.  Believers are made righteous by Christ ("\... in him we become the
    > righteousness of God." 2 Cor 5:21). What does it mean for a
    > believer to hunger and thirst for righteousness?

2.  What creates or nurtures in us a hunger and thirst for
    > righteousness?

3.  What specific areas of life does Isaiah 58:6-8 say should be
    > included our thirst for righteousness?

### Jesus Focus

In what ways did Jesus live out this beatitude? E.g. John 8:1-11

## Application

How might we live out these beatitudes in daily life? Is there something
specific you can do this week?

Sing: Take my life and let it be\...

Read Micah 6:6-8
