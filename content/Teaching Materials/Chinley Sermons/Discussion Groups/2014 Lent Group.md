# Jesus -- Lord and Brother

## Singing and Silence (tr 44-48)

Share the different ways that singing and silence have contributed to
your relationship with God. Have there been any particularly notable
times? What place have retreats played? Where / how do you find
replenishment for your soul?

The hymn, "How sweet the name of Jesus sounds" includes the words:

> Jesus! My Shepherd, Brother, Friend,\
> my Prophet, Priest and King,\
> my Lord, my Life, my Way, my End,\
> accept the praise I bring.

Select one or two words from this list which speak to you and say why.
Are there other key words you would want to add?

## Jesus our Lord and Brother

**Read Col 1:15-23, Hebrews 2:10-18**

These two passages present the greatness of Jesus who created all things
and the humanity of Jesus who sympathises with us in our weakness.

Are these two aspects of God balanced in your relationship with God? How
might each passage contribute to your daily life?

Consider the "Grace" (2Cor 13:14); how would you describe your own
experience of these three relationships?

## Growing Closer (tr 52-53)

What activities have been most significant for your growth in faith?

Are there particular areas in which you would like to grow this year?

Do you have any suggestions that might inspire or help others to grow?
