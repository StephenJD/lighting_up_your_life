# Coming to Faith for Healing

Four years ago God gave me a problem.

I believed that all we can do is pray and leave the answer to God.

When Jesus had called the Twelve together, **he gave them power and
authority** to drive out all demons and **to cure diseases**, and he
sent them out to preach the kingdom of God and **to heal the sick**.
(**Lk 9:1**)

"When you enter a town and are welcomed ... Heal the sick who are there
and tell them, 'The kingdom of God is near you.'" (**Lu 10:8-9**)

Not "according to God's will let it be done to you",

"Is it always God's will to heal?"

"Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their
synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom and healing every
disease and sickness." (**Mt 9:35**)

"Crowds gathered also from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing their
sick and those tormented by evil spirits, and **all of them were
healed**." (**Acts 5:16**)

None went home sick! Was Jesus too soft?

> Luke says, "God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and
> with power, who went about doing good and *healing all* who were
> oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him." (**Ac 10:38**)

Jesus viewed His mission as healing & deliverance:

\"Go tell that fox, 'I will drive out demons and heal people today and
tomorrow, and on the third day I will reach my goal.'" (**Lu 13:32**)

**Tinnitus, Molly, William, Helena, Grandpa with Cataracts**, **Laurence
-- no result!** **& my tinnitus!**

If the devil can't stop us praying, then he will try to keep us praying.

\"do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do; for they think that
they will be heard for their many words." (**Matt 6:7**)

Words of knowledge. **Laurence stood up!**

Whose faith? No faith is not the same as unbelief! Jesus couldn't heal
because of unbelief. **Sheila** **'s** **ear ache**:

Then Jesus looked up and said, \"Father, I thank you that you have heard
me. I knew that you always hear me, but I said this for the benefit of
the people standing here, that they may believe that you sent me.\"
(**Jn 11:41-42**)

**Sheila's broken arm** - Speak to this mountain

\"Have faith in God,\" Jesus answered. \"I tell you the truth, if anyone
says to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and does not
doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will happen, it will
be done for him. (**Mk 11:23-24**)

Mentally handicapped girl needed persistent prayer:

**Lk 18.**

Never reprimanded for too bold a faith!

> \"You of little faith, why are you so afraid?\" **(Matt 8:26)**

My favourite definition of a righteous person is this, "He gets up
again." It comes from this wonderful scripture:

> "I will look to the LORD, I will wait for the God of my salvation; my
> God will hear me. Rejoice not over me, O my enemy; when I fall, I
> shall rise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD will be a light to me."
> (**Micah 7:7-8**)

We are believers. Turn on your believer!!! Doubting is a miserable
pastime whereas there is such joy and peace in believing.

> "Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing,
> that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit." (**Rom
> 15:13**)
