# John Piper on suffering

Tsunami swept whole churches to their death.

Mark 4:41 Even the wind and the waves obey him!"

Therefore Jesus had wise and good reasons not to prevent that disaster,
and not to restrain the Carona Virus.

But does this mean He is orchestrating all these disasters -- John Piper
concludes Jesus has an active purpose for all disasters.

1.  God subjected all creation, including believers, to decay at the
    fall Romans 8:18-25

2.  For Christians this is not an experience of condemnation, but
    purification.\
    1 Cor 11:29-32 \"For those who eat and drink without discerning the
    body of Christ eat and drink **judgment on themselves**. That is why
    many among you are **weak and sick**, and a number of you have
    fallen asleep. Nevertheless, when we are **judged in this way by the
    Lord**, we are being **disciplined** so that we will not be finally
    condemned with the world.\" In other words, some believers are made
    sick or die to rescue them from condemnation.

3.  God uses disease to judge some unbelievers.\
    Acts 12:23 \"because Herod did not give praise to God, an angel of
    the Lord struck him down, and he was eaten by worms and died.\"\
    Rom 1:18 \"The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against
    all the godlessness and wickedness of people, who suppress the truth
    by their wickedness\"\
    Rom 1:27 \"Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received
    in themselves the due penalty for their error.\"

4.  All natural disasters are a call to all men everywhere to repent:
    Luke 13:1-4 \"I tell you, unless you repent, you too will all
    perish.\"

John Piper presents a persuasive biblical argument - but it is somewhat
one-sided.

First he jumps from \"Jesus has the power to stop disaster\" to
\"Therefore Jesus must intend all disaster\". The second does not flow
from the first.

His reasons for not preventing disaster may be to do with his wider
purposes in subjecting everything to decay (Rom 8) rather than having a
specific purpose for each disaster.

Secondly he presents his four points very well, but offers no balancing
scriptures, such as Rom 2:1-11 where much of the judgement is being
stored up by God for judgement day, and instead kindness is meant to
lead people to repentance.

The question is not about whether God sometimes judges believers and
unbelievers in this life, but whether that is the norm. I think we must
conclude that mercy and kindness is the norm.
