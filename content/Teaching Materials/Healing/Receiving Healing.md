# Receiving Healing

Most Christians believe that God can and does heal today -- there are
simply too many accounts of miraculous healing to deny it!

On the other hand, not everyone is healed. Indeed, for most of us our
experience is that most are not miraculously healed; mostly we heal
naturally or through doctors, and some remain sick and may die.

The Christian response to this is usually to say that God wants some
people to glorify Him in healing and health and for others to glorify
Him in their joy and peace in their sickness.

### Healing cannot be separated from the Gospel

Although it is undoubtedly true that God wants us to be thankful and
glorify Him whatever our circumstance (see for example Philippians
4:12-13) I do not believe God wants us to simply accept sickness or a
lack of healing as God\'s will. We should not simply pray and leave the
answer to God -- instead we need to learn from Jesus:

"Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their
synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom and healing
***every*** disease and sickness." (**Matt 9:35**)

None went home sick!

> Luke says, "God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and
> with power, who went about doing good and ***healing all*** who were
> oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him." (**Acts 10:38**)

Jesus viewed His mission as healing and deliverance:

\"Go tell that fox, 'I will drive out demons and heal people today and
tomorrow, and on the third day I will reach my goal.'" (**Luke 13:32**)

Healing is how Jesus demonstrates and proclaims the Gospel. In God's
Kingdom, darkness is driven out by light and sickness by healing. Jesus
commands us to repent and believe that His Kingdom has now come. Then He
commissions us to continue this proclamation ***and demonstration***.
Jesus gives power and authority to *heal*, not just to pray:

When Jesus had called the Twelve together, **he gave them power and
authority** to drive out all demons and **to cure diseases**, and he
sent them out to preach the kingdom of God and **to heal the sick**.
(**Luke 9:1**)

The Gospel accounts do not allow us to separate healing from the Gospel.
We need be in no doubt that Jesus\' will is that we should continue the
proclamation of the Gospel of His Kingdom through healing and
deliverance.

### Persisting In Faith

The best way to please God is to have bold, courageous faith in His
promises. We will never be reprimanded for too bold a faith!

> \"You of little faith, why are you so afraid?\" **(Matt 8:26)**

But in the face of persistent sickness we really struggle. We tend to
become fearful and anxious. Perhaps we give up praying for healing and
try to accept the sickness, but more often we end up pleading with God
to help us. Although this is completely understandable, and God
sympathises with us in our weakness, it really is not a good option!
Jesus says:

\"Do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do; for they think that
they will be heard for their many words." (**Matt 6:7**)

Instead, Jesus tells us to keep praying in the assurance that God always
hears us and He answers speedily; and that those to keep on asking and
knocking and seeking will receive their request from their Father. (See
Luke 18:1-8 \"Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they
should always pray and not give up\...\" and Matthew 7:7-11 - "Ask and
it will be given to you\...\").

We may not understand why we need to keep praying, but it is NOT because
God is reluctant; we actually join in with God when we pray. Doubting is
a miserable pastime whereas there is such joy and peace in believing:

> "Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing,
> that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit." (**Rom
> 15:13**)

### Getting Up Again

My favourite definition of a righteous person is this, "He gets up
again." It comes from this wonderful scripture:

> "I will look to the LORD, I will wait for the God of my salvation; my
> God will hear me. Rejoice not over me, O my enemy; when I fall, I
> shall rise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD will be a light to me."
> (**Micah 7:7-8**)
