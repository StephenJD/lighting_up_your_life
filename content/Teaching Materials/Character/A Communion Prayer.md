# A Communion Prayer

(Composed by Fr Brian shortly before he died)

Lord I come now before you,

In the weakness that has overcome me,

With the feelings I cannot share and try to hide

With the emptiness that sometimes grips me,

And with the physical and mental pain that so often preoccupies me,

But I also come in faith and trust, in humility and reverence,

And I ask to be relieved and healed.

You took human weakness on yourself when you lived,

Suffered and died for our sake,

You manifested your victory over all human weakness,

Over all negatives that tend to break us,

And over death itself.

Because of that our trust in you is deepened,

You can overcome the negative feelings we experience.

Now I present myself to you,

Knowing that you love me just as I am,

But knowing also that your will is my happiness,

And that you can bring this about in ways,

That I will not be able to understand.

Help me this day not to be undermined by illness,

By pain or problems that beset me,

I ask this not for myself but for the sake of all those whose lives I
touch.

Amen. \....
