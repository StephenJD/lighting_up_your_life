# In Christ

The NT makes it abundantly clear that no matter how much we believe in
Jesus' saving work on the cross, no matter how grateful we are, no
matter how much we celebrate it in song and in sharing the bread and
wine; all this is useless unless we are *in Christ*. 

> Jesus said to them, "Very truly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh
> of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. (John
> 6:53) 
>
> Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are *in Christ
> Jesus* (Rom 8:1) 
>
> \"the glorious riches of this Gospel is *Christ in you*, the hope of
> glory.\" (Col 1:27) 
>
> \... to be found *in him*, not having a righteousness of my own \...
> but that which is through faith in Christ (Phil 3:9) 

The point is that Jesus *Himself* is our righteousness and our
salvation. Forgiveness and salvation was not something Jesus bought for
us which we then go and pick up, or \"sign-up\" for. It was not merely
some legal deal done with God. We do not simply need to \"appropriate\"
(take something for one\'s own use) salvation; Jesus is
not *Santa* Christ, leaving gifts for us to discover in His absence! No,
we need to eat and drink Jesus, we need to become one with Him, He in us
and we in Him.  Our salvation consists of sharing in Jesus\'
relationship to the Father: 

> And God raised us up *with* Christ and seated us *with* him in the
> heavenly realms *in* Christ Jesus (Eph 2:6) 
>
> It is because of him that you are *in* Christ Jesus, *who* has become
> \... our righteousness, holiness and redemption. (1 Cor 1:30) 

Our righteousness consists in *being* *in* Christ, not
just *believing* in Him. Indeed, Jesus Himself pioneered that union: 

> The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. (John 1:14) 
>
> \"I and the Father are one." (John 10:30) 

Jesus, being a true flesh-and-blood man yet living in union with the
Father, pioneered the way for us to live in our flesh-and-blood and yet
be in union with Him, sharing His union with the Father: 

> God is faithful, who has called you into fellowship (literally:
> communion) with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. (1 Cor 1:9) 

It is in our communion and co-union with Jesus that we find our
salvation and righteousness: 

> For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God. When
> Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will appear with him
> in glory. (Col 3:3-4) 

Jesus spoke of going away and sending the Spirit, but despite the fact
that he said "***[I]{.ul}** *will come to you (Jn 14:18) we tend to
think that the Holy Spirit is the sole means by which we are united with
God. But this is not the teaching of the NT. Rather it is through the
Holy Spirit that *Christ* dwells in us, and we in Him. Thus the Holy
Spirit is sometimes called the Spirit of Christ.  

> Because you are his sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our
> hearts, the Spirit who calls out, "Abba, Father.\" (Galatians 4:6)

We are not the body of the Spirit but the body of Christ. The Spirit\'s
purpose is to reveal and make real to us our union with Christ. 

That this union is not just a union of purpose and belief, but deeply
personal and all-embracing is demonstrated by the language Paul uses in
describing it. In Eph 5:29-32 he likens it to marriage where two become
one flesh. Then in 1Cor 6:15-17 he makes the explicit comparison with
sexual union. The point being that bodily union with a prostitute
violates our union with Christ precisely because our union with Christ
includes our bodies and makes our bodies the temple of the Holy Spirit. 

Although we often talk about being saved by faith, it is not
really *faith* that saves, but Christ who saves us, and it is by faith
that we become one with Him and are thereby saved: 

> That **Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith**. And I pray
> that you ... may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.
> (Eph 3:17-19) 

Union with Christ is not a pursuit, achieved through emulating Christ\'s
holy life. It is not the reward and end of sanctification. Rather, it is
the starting point and motivation for sanctification: 

Christ and the believer have the same life. They are not separate
persons linked together by some temporary bond of friendship---they are
united by a tie as close and indissoluble as if the same blood ran in
their veins. (Strong, Systematic Theology, 802)
