# Breaking Bread -- Part 1 -- The New Passover Supper

## The Jewish background to the Last Supper

When Jesus instituted the last supper, he did not invent something new,
but fulfilled an existing celebration, the Passover supper. This meal
had a special quality that sets it apart from nearly all other
celebrations. Birthday parties, anniversary meals and reunions all look
back to some past event. Graduation parties, retirement parties,
election parties, last-night parties and so on all celebrate a recent
event. A barbeque might simply be celebrating family and friendship and
perhaps a rare but glorious summer evening.

All of these elements are in the Passover Supper, but there is another
element which makes the Passover unique; it also celebrates a future
event. It looks forward to the coming Kingdom of God. The Israelites
were delivered in the original Passover from the judgement meted out on
their Egyptian "hosts" so that they could embark on a journey towards a
liberated and blessed future in the Promised Land. Each year as they
journeyed they celebrated the Passover meal looking back to its
beginning and forward to its completion. Then, when later generations
settled in that land, they continued to celebrate the Passover, yet
still looking both backwards and forwards. They enjoyed and celebrated
what they now possessed -- which their forbears could only dream about -
but they also looked forward to a more complete experience of God's
Kingdom when the earth would be filled with the knowledge of the glory
of the LORD as the waters cover the sea (Hab 2:14).

The Passover meal was a joining together of past and future events that
gave meaning to the present. It celebrated an identity as God's people,
a calling to bring Light to the world , a deliverance from slavery to
darkness, a journey to inherit God's promises, the present blessing of
God's presence and the assurance of a place in God's glorious eternal
fully expressed Kingdom. All of this was encompassed in the Passover.

Although originally this was celebrated just once a year, by Jesus\' day
it was common practice to celebrate this in the home at least once a
week, if not at every main meal.

To the Jew every meal was a sacred participation in the gifts of God's
bountiful creation. Thanksgivings were offered before and after each
meal, understanding the food and drink as being a means of communion
with God and with one another. The blessing and breaking of the common
loaf formally opened the act of fellowship. On special occasions the
meal was concluded with a cup of mingled wine and water which was
blessed and passed round. The thanksgiving over the cup brought together
the past, the present and the future, by praising God for His provision,
remembering His redemptive action in history and praying for the coming
of His kingdom.

## Jesus' redefinition of the Passover Meal

Jesus redefined the Passover meal, giving it a new beginning, a new
middle and a new end. It is still a meal celebrating the journey of
God's people; it is still about our identity, our calling, our
deliverance our journey and our inheritance. But now Jesus Himself is
all of those things. He is the beginning, the journey and the end.

He Himself is our identity ("the church is his body, the fullness of him
who fills everything in every way." Eph 1:23), He is the Light we are
called to bring to the world, He is our deliverer, He is our sustenance
and our inheritance, He is eternally present with us, He is our hope.
And all of this, not as a memory of the past or as a dream for the
future but present in reality with us now. The architect of the Journey
has come to accompany us and to start sharing out the rewards of its
completion.

## Jesus gave the Passover meal a new beginning -- the Cross.

Jesus came announcing the arrival of the long-awaited Kingdom of God:

> "The time has come," he said. "The kingdom of God has come near.
> Repent and believe the good news!" (Mark 1:15).

Although Jesus both announced and demonstrated the presence of the
Kingdom and claimed to have bound the strong man and was now plundering
his goods, it seems that all of that was a kind of pre-view to the event
by which He became King and bound the strong man. The Cross was Jesus'
glorification and the moment of Satan's defeat. As He approached
Jerusalem at the beginning of His final week Jesus said,

> "The hour has come that the Son of Man should be glorified. Most
> assuredly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground
> and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces much grain"
> \... " Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince of
> this world will be driven out. And I, if I am lifted up from the
> earth, will draw all peoples to Myself." (John 12:23-24, 31-32)

And so, when the time came for Him to become the King of God's Kingdom,
the time of His glorification, when He would be "lifted up" on the
cross, Jesus celebrated the Passover meal:

> And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them,
> saying, "This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me."
> In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, "This cup
> is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you" (Luke
> 22:19-20).

It is notable that the Gospel writers make very little attempt to
explain the logic of the Cross. Why Jesus had to die, how His death
established the New Covenant, how His death obtained forgiveness of sins
and so on -- such questions that seem to occupy so much teaching and
preaching and scholarly writing and debate and disagreement -- get scant
attention in the Gospels. The *mechanism* of the new beginning is not
part of the Supper, only its celebration.

Jesus gives the Passover meal a new beginning -- the Cross. The
remembrance part of the meal is focused on the self-giving of Jesus as
the inauguration of a new covenant. It is not a remembrance of cruel
injustice, nor of the cost of our sin and rebellion; it is not a
remembrance of the example of Love Jesus gave us. Of course we cannot
forget any of those things, but they are not what Jesus said to
remember. Jesus commands us to remember the start of our new covenant
relationship with God our Father. He gave the supper a new beginning.

## Jesus gave the Passover meal a new middle -- feasting on Him.

The supper is a celebration of a new start, but is also more than that.
We don\'t just break the bread, we eat it. We pour out the wine and then
we drink it. As well as a remembrance of the start it is also
*nourishment* for the journey. And the journey itself is new.

The presence of God with us on the journey has a new depth and reality.
Jesus promised he would not leave us orphaned when He was glorified on
the cross. He promised to be with us always, and that the eternal
Godhead would make their home in us. We do *not* feast alone, merely
looking forward to a future real presence. Rather, just like with the
disciples on the road to Emmaus, Jesus accompanies us on the journey and
celebrates the Supper with us. But even more than that, He Himself is
the supper!

> \"For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink. Whoever eats
> my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in them\" (John
> 6:55-56)

Jesus is the real food that God gives us to sustain us on our journey
towards our inheritance. This is in contrast to the symbolic foods of
Manna, the Passover lamb and the offerings in the Law which were also
eaten. Jesus is the reality to which these things pointed. But Jesus is
also real food in contrast to the many things people crave to feed their
impoverished souls -- wealth, power, popularity, sex. And even, we might
say, Jesus is the real food in contrast to the bread and wine of the
Supper, which of themselves are only symbols of Him. Notice how Jesus
stresses real union with Him: \"they in Me, and I in them\" - words He
repeats after the Supper and again in His prayer before the cross:

> \"I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you.\" (John
> 14:20)
>
> \"that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am
> in you. May they also be in us \... that they may be one as we are
> one--- I in them and you in me (John 17:21-23)

When Jesus told the people that they must eat His flesh and drink His
blood, He was not telling them to share the broken bread and poured out
wine of the Lord\'s supper; He was talking about being one with Him;
sharing His life and identity:

> \"If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart
> from me you can do nothing.\" (John 15:5)

So Jesus gave Himself as the New Covenant which we remember as the start
of our journey, and He also gives Himself to us as our daily bread for
the journey, sustaining our soul and spirit. We feast on Him.

But we need more than sustenance along the journey. We also need
guidance and companionship and comfort and motivation. Jesus is all of
these as well (Jn 14:16,23,26, 16:13, Matt 28:20). Jesus gave the Supper
a new middle.

## Jesus gave the Passover meal a new end -- His Kingdom on earth.

Jesus gave the Supper a new beginning and a new middle. But as we have
seen, the uniqueness of the Passover meal was in that it also looked
forward to an assured future; and Jesus gave the supper a new end. He
said:

> "I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.
> For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it finds fulfilment in
> the kingdom of God." After taking the cup, he gave thanks and said,
> "Take this and divide it among you. For I tell you I will not drink
> again from the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes."
> (Luke 22:15-18. See also Matt 26:29 and Mark 14:25)

We do not have to wait for long! On the day of the resurrection Jesus
ate fish with the disciples, then broke bread on the road to Emmaus, and
shared breakfast with the disciples on the shores of Galilee, and
according to Peter, Jesus ate and drank with many other witnesses of the
resurrection (Acts 10:41). The fact that Jesus ate and drank with so
many after the resurrection shows us that the Kingdom of God has indeed
come.

And the fifth gospel, Acts, bears powerful testimony that the Kingdom
has indeed come. All the leaders in Jerusalem that had conspired
together to kill Jesus were confronted with the irrefutable evidence
that Jesus was establishing His kingdom through the disciples.

> "It is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified but
> whom God raised from the dead, that this man stands before you
> healed." (Acts 4:10)

It is this third aspect of the Supper which is perhaps most
misunderstood and challenging to embrace. It wouldn't be a problem if we
could simply see the Supper as looking forward to the Wedding Supper of
the Lamb in Revelation 19:9, but Jesus does not give us that option
(although that is how most Christians actually take it). Jesus did not
put off "eating again until the kingdom comes" to the second coming. He
got on with it as soon as He rose from the dead. The "end" to which the
supper looks has already arrived. The Kingdom has come and Jesus is the
King.

Most of us live as if Jesus came to start a resistance movement rather
than to announce His Kingdom. This is a huge subject in itself and here
is not the place to explore it. But given that the Gospel is the
announcement of the Kingdom, we must recognise that the Lord's Supper is
therefore also a celebration and proclamation of its presence and not
merely an anticipation of a far-off dream.

There is an element that, for the moment, is still in the future - Paul
said: "Whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the
Lord's death until he comes." (1 Cor 11:26). But we must not read this
as if the new end that Jesus gives to the Supper is a distant dream --
the victorious second coming of Jesus. Yes, that is there in part, and
there are aspects of the new end which remain to be inherited in their
fullness. But the radical new end that Jesus has given the Supper is the
Gospel itself -- the announcement that the Kingdom of God has come!
Jesus has met us on the journey and brought our inheritance into our
present.

Jesus is King, here today, on this earth. And it is our commission to
make that fact known and invite people to take part. We are not a
resistance movement waiting for the D-Day landings; they have already
taken place and we are commissioned to take the ground that Jesus has
won and tear down the machinery of oppression that continues to
intimidate and enslave those who are ignorant of the new Kingdom. Our
discipleship consists of laying hold of our inheritance and working it
out in the here and now.

Jesus has given the Supper new meaning, and to share in the Supper is to
share primarily in a celebration -- celebration of the New Covenant,
celebration of the sustaining presence of Jesus and our union with Him,
celebration of His guiding presence with us along the way and
celebration of the present reality of God's Kingdom on earth and our
inheritance of every blessing in Christ.

Of course, along with the celebration there is also recognition of the
cost of our inheritance in Christ's suffering (of which the scriptures
make very little) but also, more significantly, we recognise our
incomplete comprehension and experience of the Kingdom of God. We
continue to long for and pray for the Kingdom to come on earth as it is
in Heaven.

This then, is the Lord's Supper; His remodelling of the Passover supper.

In part 2 we will consider the practice of the Supper and some other
aspects of its meaning.
