# The Gospel in 1 Corinthians

In chapters 1-3 Paul uses the cross as an illustration of the
\"foolishness\" of the Gospel in order to challenge the behaviour of the
Corinthians who are arguing with on another. His answer is that the
Gospel is a Gospel of power, not of \[human\] words. 

Paul\'s occasional references to Christ\'s death in  the letter are
actually to His resurrection rather than to the cross, for instance 1
Cor 6:14.

In ch 10 and 11 Paul uses the last-supper as an appeal to unity, but
without any reference to the cross.

It is not until Ch 15 that Paul offers any glimpse of his Gospel, and
here His focus is on the Resurrection. Even when he describes our death,
he relates it to Adam rather than the cross (v22). Paul seems to be
entirely focused on our Life in Christ; His resurrection and ours with
Him.
