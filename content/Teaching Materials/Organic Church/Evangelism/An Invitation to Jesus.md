| Hello, my name is .... What's your name?                             |
|                                                                      |
| *\[Name\]* I want you to know that God loves you and He has a        |
| wonderful purpose for your life.                                     |
|                                                                      |
| What do you think of that? \... Do you have any sickness? Can I pray |
| for you?                                                             |

| "Lord, I pray that you bless *\[name\]* and his / her family with    |
| long and healthy lives. Make yourself so real to him / her and help  |
| *\[name\]* to come to know your love and discover your good purpose  |

| Before I go, can I ask you this question? If you were to die today,  |
| do you know for sure, without a shadow of a doubt, that you would go |
| straight to heaven?\                                                 |

| -   "For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God"         |
|                                                                      |

|     life through Jesus Christ"                                       |
|                                                                      |
