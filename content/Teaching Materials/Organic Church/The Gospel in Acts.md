> cross. But God raised him from the dead, freeing him from the agony of
> death, because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on
> him\.... "Therefore let all Israel be assured of this: God has made

> how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power
> of the devil, because God was with him\.... He commanded us to preach

> his name."

> was shaken. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke
> the word of God boldly.
>
> Acts 8:5-7, 12 Philip went down to a city in Samaria and proclaimed
> the Messiah there. When the crowds heard Philip and saw the signs he
> performed, they all paid close attention to what he said. For with
> shrieks, impure spirits came out of many, and many who were paralyzed
> or lame were healed\.... when they believed Philip as he proclaimed
> the good news of the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they
> were baptized, both men and women.
>
> Acts 14:3 \"the Lord confirmed the message of his grace by enabling
> them to perform signs and wonders \...
>
> Acts 28:8-9 The chief official\'s father was sick in bed, suffering
> from fever and dysentery. Paul went in to see him and, after prayer,
> placed his hands on him and healed him. When this had happened, the
> rest of the sick on the island came and were cured.

## Disciples who did not heal

Acts 9:32-43 In Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha \... who became
sick and died, \... so when the disciples heard that Peter was in Lydda,
they \... urged him, "Please come at once!" \... Turning toward the dead
woman, Peter said, "Tabitha, get up." She opened her eyes, and sat up.
