Jesus said, "You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in
order to observe your own traditions!" **Mark 7:9**.

We are often blind to our own traditions and jump to defend them when
challenged. Let's try asking a few questions about our common church
practices and see what emerges. Let us imagine the process for a person
coming to faith and becoming part of the church...

# Presenting the Gospel

## Our Tradition

We have been taught to share the *Gospel of Christ* by explaining how
sin has separated us from God and how Jesus paid our penalty by His
death on the cross. We need to confess our sins and ask for forgiveness.

The astonishing fact is that more than 90% of people who "respond" to
this version of the gospel do ***not*** go on to become disciples of
Jesus.

## Jesus' Command

**Gospel of the Kingdom, not the Gospel of Christ**

> He sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to perform
> healing. **Luke 9:2**

The Gospel of the Kingdom has mostly been replaced in our evangelism and
preaching with the Gospel of Christ. In other words, instead of talking
about the good news concerning the Kingdom of God, we talk about the
good news of Jesus dying for our sins on the cross. Yet even after the
cross, the apostles continued to preach the *Gospel of the Kingdom* and
the truth about Christ - even to the Gentiles, who did not have any
expectation or understanding of the Jewish concept of God's kingdom:

> "God's salvation has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will listen!"
> For two whole years Paul stayed there \... He proclaimed the **kingdom
> of God** and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ! **Act 28:28**

### The starting-point for the Gospel

Jesus instructed that the preaching of the Gospel should start with
healing. The apostles and Paul continued to make healing the
starting-point for presenting the Gospel.

When Jesus instructed the 70 how to share the Gospel he said, "Heal the
sick who are there and tell them, 'The kingdom of God is near you.'"
**Luke 10:9**

When describing His own ministry He said, "I will keep on driving out
demons and healing people today and tomorrow, and on the third day I
will reach my goal." **Luke 13:32**

When Peter describes Jesus' ministry he says "God anointed Jesus of
Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good
and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him."
**Ac 10:38**

When Paul described his ministry he said, "My message and my preaching
were not with wise and persuasive words, but with a demonstration of the
Spirit's power, so that your faith might not rest on men's wisdom, but
on God's power." ... "For the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but
of power." **1Co 2:4-5, 1Co 4:20**

**The Message**

Having demonstrated God's presence and power with healing and
deliverance from demons, the message preached was also about deliverance
-- deliverance from the kingdom of darkness into God's Kingdom of Light.
That is why it was called the Gospel of the Kingdom.

When Jesus announced His mission He said "The Spirit of the Lord is on
me, because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has
sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for
the blind, to release the oppressed, to proclaim the year of the Lord's
favour." **Lk 4:18-19**

The Gospel of the Kingdom is good news to the poor and oppressed. It
does not require explanation as to why it is good news. But the
self-righteous and self-sufficient will not realise their need. Yet many
who are outwardly prosperous are oppressed by inner torment. The Gospel
of the Kingdom is not about going to heaven when we die, but being set
free to live in God's good Kingdom now. It is a gospel of entering into
God's Goodness now.

**Repentance**

> "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and
> believe in the gospel." **Mark 1:15**

The repentance called for in the Gospel of the Kingdom is focused on
turning from the kingdom of Darkness to the Kingdom of Light. It is
repentance from our rebellion and independence from God. It is about the
whole direction and focus of our lives. It is not really about the
individual sins that we might be able to recount -- such a focus
encourages a focus on our past and future performance, rather than the
underlying motivations in our lives.

We never read of Jesus asking anyone to confess and repent of their
sins; He simply announces forgiveness as part of the Kingdom message.

**Demonstration, not just explanation**

The clear emphasis of the Gospel Jesus has commanded us to preach is one
of ***delivering*** people from the power of Satan and healing them. The
Gospel Jesus commanded us to preach is not an *explanation* but a
*demonstration* of the God who sets us free. Fear and powerlessness has
driven us to abandon the demonstration and rely upon explanation. The
rise of individualism has led us to abandon the Gospel of the Kingdom
and adopt an emasculated individualistic gospel.

# The response to the gospel

## Our Tradition

We have been taught that the proper response to hearing the gospel is to
pray the sinner's prayer: asking for God's forgiveness and inviting Him
into their life as Lord and Saviour. We have been taught that when a
person prays this prayer, they are born again and belong to God.

## Jesus' Command

Jesus taught that the proper response to the Gospel is *immediate*
baptism.

When Nicodemus asked how he could be saved, Jesus replied, "Very truly I
tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of
water (baptism) and the Spirit (baptism in the Holy Spirit)." **John
3:5**

Peter taught the same: "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the
name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will
receive the gift of the Holy Spirit." **Acts 2:38**

> Those who accepted his message were baptized, **Acts 2:41**

After Philip had told him the good news about Jesus, the Ethiopian
eunuch said, "Look, here is water. What can stand in the way of my being
baptized?" **Acts 8:35-36**

Ananias said to Paul on his conversion, "And now what are you waiting
for? Get up, be baptized and wash your sins away, calling on his name."
**Acts 22:16**

The Philippian gaoler asked, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?" The
response was "immediately he and all his household were baptized."
**Acts 16:29-33**.

If a person who wants to become a Christian does not say "I want to be
baptised" then we have not shared the Gospel as Jesus commanded.

# Baptism

## Our Tradition

We have been taught that salvation is by faith alone, and not by any act
or merit on our part. We have been taught that baptism is a *symbol* of
sharing in Jesus' death on the cross and rising again with Him in His
resurrection. We have been taught that baptism must be undertaken
seriously and after proper instruction, so that a person properly
understands what they are doing. We have been taught that Baptism is a
public declaration of our commitment to follow Jesus.

## Jesus' Command

Although salvation is occasionally described without mention of baptism,
the overwhelming evidence of the NT is that baptism was considered to be
an integral and necessary act in a person's salvation. To separate
baptism from salvation is something that the Bible does not permit us to
do. No one who wishes to be obedient to Jesus can excuse themselves from
baptism.

Since the NT presents baptism as the *means* of entering the Kingdom of
God, it is never separated from conversion, as a separate event. The
notion that someone can be saved, and then instructed in preparation for
baptism, is totally absent. If preparation classes are deemed necessary,
they should be re-classified as salvation classes, not baptism classes.

Nowhere does the NT teach that baptism should be a public event. On the
contrary, both the Philippian gaoler's family and the Ethiopian eunuch
had private baptisms.

Neither Jesus nor any New Testament writer ever says that baptism is a
symbol. It is always presented as the *means* by which a person enters
the Kingdom of God. The death of Jesus on the cross and His resurrection
from the dead is what *Jesus* did so that we could be saved, but what
*we* must do is be baptised in water and the Holy Spirit.

> "Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless
> they are born of water (baptism) and the Spirit (baptism in the Holy
> Spirit)." **John 3:5**
>
> Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved. **Mark 16:16**

Yes, salvation is by faith alone, but faith is expressed by obedience,
and Jesus commanded baptism in water and the Holy Spirit.

Speaking about the waters of the Flood, Peter says, "this water
symbolizes baptism that now saves you also---not the removal of dirt
from the body but the pledge of a clear conscience toward God. It saves
you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ" **1 Peter 3:21**

Peter doesn't say that baptism symbolises our death and resurrection
with Jesus, but that the flood symbolises baptism. Baptism is the real
thing, and Peter twice says that "baptism saves you".

Through baptism we are forgiven for our sins and set free from the
control of our old nature:

> "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ
> for the forgiveness of your sins." **Acts 2:38**
>
> Your whole self, ruled by the flesh was put off when you were
> circumcised by Christ, having been buried with him in baptism, in
> which you were also raised with him through your faith in the working
> of God, who raised him from the dead. **Col 2:11-12**

Through baptism we die and rise again to become God's children, clothed
with Christ:

> We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order
> that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the
> Father, we too may live a new life. **Rom 6:4**

### In Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith, for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. Gal 3:26-27

If we profess faith in Christ and a desire to trust and obey Him, how
can we possibly say that we do not need to repent and be baptised for
the forgiveness of our sins? It is what the bible teaches.

# Baptism in the Holy Spirit

## Our Tradition

We have been taught that everyone who repents of their sins and asks
Jesus into their lives is born-again and automatically receives the Holy
Spirit. Some who are hungry for more of God may later be baptised in the
Holy Spirit and receive various Spiritual gifts, such as speaking in
tongues.

## Jesus' Command

Jesus said that without the HS we are orphans -- starved of love and
unable to relate properly to our Father.

The Holy Spirit is not an optional-extra:

> "Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless
> they are born of water (baptism) and the Spirit (baptism in the Holy
> Spirit)." **John 3:5**
>
> "Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my Father promised,
> which you have heard me speak about. For John baptized with water, but
> in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit... You will
> receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you" **Acts 1:5,8**
>
> "He saved us through the washing of rebirth (baptism in water) and
> renewal by the Holy Spirit." **Titus 3:5**

There is no assurance of salvation apart from the Holy Spirit:

> "Having believed, you were marked in Him with a seal, the promised
> Holy Spirit, Who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance"
> **Ephesians 1:13-14**
>
> "We know that we live in Him and He in us, because He has given us of
> His Spirit." **1 John 4:13**

Although the Spirit is promised, He is *not* given automatically when we
believe in Jesus or are baptised. Jesus taught that we must ask the
Father to give us the Spirit:

"So I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will
find; knock and the door will be opened to you. ... If you then, though
you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much
more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask
him!" **Luke 11:9-13**

Sometimes, such as for Cornelius (Acts 10:44) God baptises believers in
the Holy Spirit without them praying, but it is much more usual for
prayer to be required, even for baptised believers:

When they arrived, they prayed for them that they might receive the Holy
Spirit, because the Holy Spirit had not yet come upon any of them; they
had simply been baptised into the name of the Lord Jesus. Then Peter and
John placed their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit."
**Acts 8:12-17**

> On hearing this, they were baptised into the name of the Lord Jesus.
> When Paul placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and
> they spoke in tongues and prophesied. **Acts 19:2-6**

Nowhere do we see any other understanding of receiving the Holy Spirit
in the New Testament, other than the baptism of the Holy Spirit which
was usually manifested by the recipients' speaking in tongues. On what
authority can we teach baptism in the Holy Spirit as an optional extra?

# Repentance and Righteousness

## Our Tradition

We have been taught that in order to be forgiven we need to confess our
sins, and that we need to keep doing this as often as we are aware of
having sinned. We are taught that we are sinners, saved by grace and
will constantly fail in our struggle against temptation.

## Jesus' Command

> Repentance for the forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to
> all nations (**Luke 24:47**)
>
> Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out
> (**Acts 3:19**)
>
> "God has granted repentance that leads to life." (**Acts 11:18**)

Jesus and the Apostles always associated both repentance and forgiveness
with conversion. Repentance was required for faith -- it is a change of
view about Christ and God's Kingdom, not repentance from wrongdoing.
Likewise, forgiveness is eternal saving forgiveness, not short-term
conscience-cleansing forgiveness.

> "Everyone who believes in Him receives forgiveness of sins" (**Acts
> 10:43**)

Confession of our sinful acts is never mentioned in connection with
salvation. Teaching about confession is often based upon a
misunderstanding of:

> "If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is
> not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will
> forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness." (**1John
> 1:8-9**)

In this opening passage of his letter John is talking about the Gospel
he has proclaimed to them; the gospel through which they were saved; the
Gospel that demands repentance from the kingdom of darkness to the
Kingdom of light (v5-7). Those who deny their need for repentance are
deceived, but those who confess their previous deception are made
righteous (v8-10). That this is about salvation rather than our daily
lives as believers is shown in the verses that follow:

> "If anybody does sin, we have an advocate with the Father---Jesus
> Christ, the Righteous One. He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins."

As believers we live in the wonder of continuing forgiveness because
Jesus' death was sufficient for us. We are now to live in the joy of
knowing that Jesus is our righteousness:

> For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves
> with Christ. (**Gal 3:27**)

We are not supposed to live with a continuing reminder of our sin:

> "Having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our
> Lord Jesus Christ" (**Rom 5:1**)
>
> For by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being
> made holy... "Their sins and lawless acts I will remember no more."
> (**Heb 10:14,17**)

The problem with seeing repentance as a daily requirement for dealing
with sinful acts is that it takes our attention away from the major
repentance issue of the focus and direction of our lives and feeds
unbelief and self-righteousness concerning the effectiveness of the
Cross in dealing with our sin once and for all time.

# Joining a Church

Perhaps the hardest aspect of tradition for us to recognise is regarding
our concept of church. We readily see that there are a variety of
traditions in the various denominations, but really they are all small
variations on a very dominant theme -- maintaining an institution of
instruction and control.

One of the biggest disconnects between the New Testament and church as
we know it must surely be the contrast between the modest attention to
church administration in the New Testament and the massive amount of
effort and resources that we pour into maintaining our church
traditions.

The New Testament teaching about "church" (literally *assemblies*) is:

1.  Disciples of Jesus should assemble together to encourage one another
    > and stir one another to love and good works (Heb 10:24).

2.  Everyone should take part in this encouragement (1 Cor 14:26,
    > 1Thess5:11).

3.  Assemblies should rejoice in song and thanksgiving together (Eph
    > 5:18-21).

4.  They should share a meal of remembrance together (1 Cor 11:23--26)

5.  Jesus has given us all different gifts to serve the body of Christ
    > (Rom 12:4-8, Eph 4:11-13, 1 Cor 12:7-11)

6.  Assemblies in a town should have elders to oversee and correct any
    > false teaching that may arise (Titus 1:5-9).

7.  Elders are to lead by example and not through control (1 Pet 5:3)

8.  Members are expected to submit to one another and to their overseers
    > (elders) (Eph 5:21, Heb 13:17).

9.  Assemblies should maintain holiness amongst the members (1 Cor
    > 5:12-13).

This is a small and simple set of instructions for assemblies of
disciples which were generally small enough to meet in people's homes
and function like extended families.

## Our Tradition

In most cases, Church has been transformed from a family into an
institution. The consequences of this are:

1.  A new believer is expected to be committed to attending Sunday
    > worship every week and to attend the week-day bible study and
    > prayer meetings.

2.  A new believer is likely to be encouraged to get involved in some
    > aspect of maintaining the church programs, perhaps helping set
    > things up before a service or welcoming people when they arrive.

3.  A new believer will be encouraged to give financially for the
    > maintenance of the church programs.

4.  A new believer is likely to see conforming to the culture of the
    > church as more important than conforming to Christ.

## Jesus' Command

Jesus spoke at length about what is required for a Christian to be
fruitful. Jesus didn't say to join a church, He said to join Him:

> "Remain in me, as I also remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by
> itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless
> you remain in me. I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain
> in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do
> nothing." **John 15:4-5**

Jesus pointed to answered prayer, not progress up a church hierarchy, as
the measure of fruitful discipleship:

> "If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you
> wish, and it will be done for you. This is to my Father's glory, that
> you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples ... You did
> not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you so that you might go
> and bear fruit---fruit that will last---and so that whatever you ask
> in my name the Father will give you." **John 15:7-8, 16**

Jesus did not command that we conform to church culture, but that we
love one another:

> "If you keep my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have
> kept my Father's commands and remain in his love. I have told you this
> so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete. My
> command is this: Love each other as I have loved you." **John
> 15:10-12**

-   If the primary experience within a 'church' is not answered prayer
    > and love for one another, then we have departed from God's pattern
    > for church.

-   If the assembling together does not consist of each one sharing and
    > encouraging the other, then we have departed from God's pattern
    > for church.

-   If the assembling together does not include sharing a meal in which
    > we celebrate the New Covenant, then we have departed from God's
    > pattern for church.

# The Truth that Sets us Free

## Our Tradition

We have been taught that correct doctrine is of utmost importance; that
personal and corporate bible study is how we grow as disciples; that
*truth* is correct understanding, that knowledge is freedom.

## Jesus' Command

> Jesus said, "If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples.
> Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free ... Very
> truly I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin ... if the Son
> sets you free, you will be free indeed." **John 8:31-33**

Sin is really just another word for idolatry. All sin consists of
thinking that something other than God's perfect will is more desirable.
It is a deceit, because the real truth is that there is never anything
more perfect, more truly satisfying, more comforting, more fulfilling,
more affirming, more exciting, more anything than God's perfect will for
us. So if we sin, it is because we wrongly see something other than God
as better than God. Our "eyes" are wrong, and because of that we are
deceived and obey that idol - we are slaves to sin.

So the truth that sets us free is not correct doctrine, but Jesus
Himself. I am not led into sin by mistaken or faulty understanding of
the atonement or by misunderstanding a parable or not being able to
expound the letter to the Romans. What I need is a new heart and new
eyes to see and love Jesus. I need to "abide" in Jesus and let His word
abide in me. The truth that sets us free is not doctrinal, it is
incarnational -- Jesus living in me. This happens through baptism in
water and baptism in the Holy Spirit followed by feeding on the word of
Jesus under the tutorship of the Holy Spirit.

# Peace and Unity

## Our Tradition

We are taught to maintain the unity and peace of the local church by
being kind and gentle and tolerant and understanding. Cultures vary
widely in the degree to which people are expected to say what a person
wants to hear, rather than to speak the truth, but we often feel that
the "loving" thing to do is to say something other than the truth. We
try not to do and say things that might upset others.

## Jesus' Command

Jesus commands us to love one another as he loves us. These are some of
the ways Jesus loved people:

> "Those whom I love I rebuke and discipline." **Rev 3:19**
>
> Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a
> stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the concerns of God,
> but merely human concerns." **Matt 16:23**
>
> "You unbelieving and perverse generation," Jesus replied, "how long
> shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you?" **Matt
> 17:17**
>
> But He turned and rebuked them and said, "You do not know what manner
> of spirit you are of." **Lk 9:55**
>
> Later Jesus appeared to the Eleven as they were eating; he rebuked
> them for their lack of faith and their stubborn refusal to believe
> those who had seen him after he had risen. **Mark 16:14**
>
> "Martha, Martha," the Lord answered, "you are worried and upset about
> many things, but few things are needed---or indeed only one. Mary has
> chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her." **Lk
> 10:41-42**

Jesus would not have lasted long in most of our churches. He was far too
outspoken and divisive. But when He rebuked Peter He got to the heart of
the problem: "you do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely
human concerns".

We are called to live with Kingdom Culture, not man-made culture. When
deciding what to do and say we should have the concerns of God in mind
and not the fear of man. We are called to love one another as Christ
loves us -- that implies that we need to learn from Jesus what love
truly looks like. In Jesus, love is never divorced from truth.

# Discipleship

## Our Tradition

We have understood the Great Commission as "go and make disciples of all
nations, teaching them everything I have commanded you."

We equate faith with doctrine. As a result of this error:

-   Believing and understanding "correct" doctrine is our measure of
    > maturity.

-   We equate disciple making with teaching.

-   Preaching and bible study are our primary, and often sole means of
    > discipleship.

-   We discuss and teach and listen till the cows come home...

-   Keen Christians go to conferences and do more bible study and go to
    > theological college so they can become leaders

## Jesus' Command

> Jesus said "teach them to ***obey*** everything I have commanded you."
> He said, "Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and
> ***obey*** it." He said, "Everyone who hears these words of mine and
> does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his
> house on sand." **Matt 28:20**, **Lk 11:28, Matt 7:26**

Faith is not understanding and agreeing with doctrinal truth. It is
trusting and obeying Jesus. That is how Jesus defines faith.

Teaching has an important role to play, but only in conjunction with
demonstrating and practicing obedience. Discipling is an apprenticeship,
not a class-room exercise. The teacher says, "Come and follow me..."

We have abandoned the apprenticeship for the classroom because according
to Jesus, discipleship starts with demonstrating the Kingdom of God
through healing and deliverance. It is so much easier to talk about this
than to actually demonstrate it!

# Mission

## Our Tradition

We are taught to bring our friends and neighbours to church so they can
hear the preaching of the Gospel and be saved. The pastor is the expert
and those few who are growing into leadership take a turn now and again.

## Jesus' Command

> "And as you go, preach, saying, 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.'
> Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons.
> Freely you received, freely give ... And whatever city or village you
> enter, inquire who is worthy in it, and stay at his house until you
> leave that city." **Matt 10:7-11**

Jesus never said to bring people to church so the pastor could minister
to them. He said to go into people's homes and give away what you have
freely received.

Our replacement of the simple family assembly with the centralised
church organisation has reversed the focus of mission and ministry.

# Becoming a Leader

## Our Tradition

We are taught that the church needs leaders to perform all the various
functions and organise all its activities. Leadership positions are
often given (and even created) to reward faithfulness and commitment.

When looking for leaders we look for people who agree with us, people
who have the skills to lead and organise others, people who are
knowledgeable and skilled in using the bible.

Leadership is organised in a hierarchy under the lead pastor's authority
and is used as a means of control. Obedience and submission is expected
of those being lead, and the sub-leaders serve the main leader.

## Jesus' Command

Jesus turns leadership on its head. His church structure is flat rather
than hierarchical. He alone is the head, and everyone else reports
directly to Him. Leadership is a gift of service to the body of Christ,
along with all the other gifts that every member provides.

"You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it
over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them. Not so
with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your
servant, and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all." **Mk
10:42-44**

> Just as each of us has one body with many members, and these members
> do not all have the same function, so in Christ we who are many form
> one body, and each member belongs to all the others. **Rom 12:4-5**

Kingdom leadership depends not upon authority and duty but on vision,
inspiration, example, empowerment and love.

We have adopted the world's model of leadership within the church,
thinking ourselves wiser than Jesus.

# Sent and Released...

## Our Tradition

We are taught that if we feel the calling of God to start a new ministry
or leave the church to take the gospel to another place, we need to get
the blessing and release of the pastor. Yet the hardest thing for a
pastor to do is to release leaders or church members to leave the church
to obey their calling to go into all the world and make disciples. These
people are probably the keenest, hardest working, most generous givers,
closest friends and most ardent supporters of the pastor. The temptation
for a pastor is always to say, "Just wait a little longer, you are not
quite ready yet..."

## Jesus' Command

> "As the Father has sent me, I am sending you." **Jn 20:21**
>
> "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of
> the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field.
> Go! I am sending you out like lambs among wolves." **Lk 10:2-3**
>
> "Freely you received, freely give..." **Matt 10:8**

The fact is that none of us are ever ready. There is always more to
learn, more to practice, more to be done before we go. We should always
seek the blessing of those who have been our Christian family, but in
the end we must obey and trust Jesus if he is calling us to go beyond
what our leaders are prepared to allow. Jesus was clear that family does
not trump obedience to Jesus. (**Matt 12:47-50, John 2:3-4**)
