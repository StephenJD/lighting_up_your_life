# The American Awakening Script

Hi, my name is .... What's your name?

\[Name\] I've just got to tell you two things real quick; that God loves
you and He has an awesome plan for your life.

Befire I go, I've got to ask you a real quick question. If you were to
die today, do you know for sure, without a shadow of a doubt, that you
would go straight to heaven?

\[if "Yes" say\] Great! Why would you say yes?

\[If they don't say they are born again, carry on...\]

Great! Let me tell you three things the bible says:

1.  "For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God"

2.  "The wages of sin is death, but the FREE gift of God is eternal life
    through Jesus Christ"

3.  "Whosoever calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved"

You're a "whosoever" right? Of course you are, we all are. So before I
go, I'm going to say a quick prayer for you.

"Lord, I pray that you bless \[name\] and his / her family with long and
healthy lives. Make yourself so real to him / her and if \[name\] has
never received Jesus Christ as his / her Lord and Saviour, I pray that
he/she would do so right now.

\[name\] If you would like to receive this free gift; Jesus Christ as
your Lord and Saviour, just say this with me...

Jesus come into my heart. // Forgive me of my sins // Wash me // change
me // and set me free. // Let me never be the same again. // Jesus, I
believe you died for me. // Help me to live for you. // And fulfil
everything You have called me to do. // I thank you that I'm now
forgiven // and on my way to heaven. // In Jesus name, Amen.

\[Name\] I have the best news anyone will ever tell you. As a minister
of the gospel of Jesus Christ, I tell you that all your sins are
forgiven right now! And you can know for sure that you're on your way to
heaven. Remember, when you make a mistake, don't run from God, run to
Him, because He loves you and He does have an awesome plan for your
life.
