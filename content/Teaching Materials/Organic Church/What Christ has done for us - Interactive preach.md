# What Christ has done for us

## Get the youth to act this story out:

> Rev 12:7-12 Then war broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels
> fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back.
> But he was not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven. The
> great dragon was hurled down---that ancient serpent called the devil,
> or Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the
> earth, and his angels with him.
>
> Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say: "Now have come the salvation
> and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his
> Messiah. For the accuser of our brothers and sisters, who accuses them
> before our God day and night, has been hurled down. They triumphed
> over him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony;
> they did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death.
> Therefore rejoice, you heavens and you who dwell in them! But woe to
> the earth and the sea, because the devil has gone down to you! He is
> filled with fury, because he knows that his time is short."

The devil wants us to be sin-conscious; God wants us to be
righteousness-conscious. Paul warns us to guard against the fiery darts
of the evil one by wearing the breastplate of righteousness:

> Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist,
> with the breastplate of righteousness in place (Eph 6:14).

Whose righteousness do you suppose we wear?

## Get people to discuss in threes, each verse, one at a time

After each verse, get several people to say what it means to them.

> He forgave us all our sins, having cancelled the accusation against
> us. He has taken it away, nailing it to the cross. **Col 2:10-14**
>
> "Having been justified (declared righteous) by faith, we have peace
> with God through our Lord Jesus Christ" **Rom 5:1**
>
> For by one sacrifice Jesus has made perfect forever those who are
> being made holy... "Their sins and lawless acts I will remember no
> more." **Heb 10:14,17**
>
> For he has rescued us from the kingdom of darkness and brought us into
> Jesus\' kingdom, through whom our sins are forgiveness. **Col 1:13**

## Interview one person over this passage

Get them to \"preach\" each phrase, and ask the congregation for help
with anything they don\'t quite understand.

> But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's
> special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called
> you out of darkness into his wonderful light. Once you were not a
> people, but now you are the people of God; once you had not received
> mercy, but now you have received mercy. **1 Peter 2:9-10**
