## Using this prayer guide

The joy and power of prayer cannot be adequately described or explained.
It is a wonderful mystery that must be experienced through practice. In
prayer we lift our hearts to God and enter most deeply into the
relationship of Father, Son and Holy Spirit. In answer to prayer, God
moves mountains.

The words on these pages are not prayers in themselves. The words become
prayer only when they have sunk into the deepest places of our hearts
and rise up again as our own united with our faith.

Use *Morning Prayer* every day for seven days. Try to stick to the same
time each day if you can. There is a very short guide for *Prayer Before
Bed* as well which simply uses the same Psalm as morning prayer. Try to
use both forms of prayer each day.

**Preparation** for prayer begins with **recognition** that God is here
with us and we become more deeply aware of His presence as we still our
minds with the prayer of **stillness**:

> Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, thank you for your mercy to me.

'Lord' because Jesus is God.\
'Christ' which means 'anointed one' because Jesus was anointed with the
Holy Spirit as King.\
'Son of God' meaning Jesus is the Son in the Trinity of Father, Son and
Holy Spirit. The Son who has always existed with God the Father and the
Spirit and through whom all things were created.\
'thank you for your mercy' because Jesus came and rescued us and gave us
what we didn't deserve, eternal life in Him. So we begin with thanks for
His goodness to us.

To use this prayer of stillness start by praying the words out loud,
taking a breath half way through after 'Son of God'. Focus your mind on
Jesus as you repeat the words. To begin with, lots of thoughts will come
into your mind about all kinds of things. Try not to follow these
thoughts. Instead, keep pulling your mind back to the words of the
prayer and to Jesus. Gradually your mind will become quieter and you can
start to pray the prayer silently in your mind. It helps to match the
words to your breathing so that you breathe in for 'Lord Jesus Christ,
Son of God' and breathe out for 'thank you for your mercy'. When you
feel peaceful and you feel the love of Jesus filling your heart you are
ready to begin praising God.

**Praise** follows thanksgiving. We use the words from the one of the
Apostle Paul's letters which the first Christians would have prayed or
sung to worship Jesus together. The song of praise is followed by the
short prayer giving glory to the Holy Trinity 'Glory to the Father...'.
Try speaking both of these out loud or chanting or singing them. It
makes a powerful difference to how the words effect your heart.

Next we focus on the Bible, the **Word of God**. Because it is inspired
by God it is not only the words of the human writers but, through the
power of the Holy Spirit, the Bible becomes God's words to us leading us
to Himself, the source of all life; to Jesus who is The Word of God, The
Way, The Truth and The Life.

The **Psalms** were the prayers and songs of the Jewish people. As a
Jew, Jesus himself would have learned and recited the Psalms. Right from
the start Christians have taken the Psalms and reinterpreted them in the
light of Jesus and used them to worship and pray to Him as our Lord and
King. Here there are seven Psalms, one for each day, which we can pray,
chant or sing to lift our hearts to God. If you have time, it is helpful
to pray through the Psalm slowly by responding to and expanding on each
line with your own words.

The Psalm is followed by a **reading** from the Old or New Testament. It
is good to read the short passage for the day several times until it
becomes familiar. Ask the Holy Spirit to speak to you through it and
bring you closer to Jesus.

When we are ready to respond in our hearts to the reading there is a
written **response** to focus our minds and hearts on Jesus. It also
includes a time of silence to allow the Holy Spirit to work in our
heart.

When we feel the Holy Spirit drawing us to make **requests** of the
Father we can begin with The Lord's Prayer, saying the words slowly,
pausing between each line to allow specific prayers to rise from our
hearts.

The Lord's Prayer is followed by a time of **intercession**, praying in
our own words for specific people and things. At this point you should
expect the Holy Spirit to continue to guide you as you pray. You may
also find that your heart fills with a deep love for the people you are
praying for. This is one of the sweetest experiences of the love of God
flowing through you which is matched only by the sense of God's love
felt as you serve people face to face with healing, encouragement,
generosity, hospitality and comfort.

Using a **litany** at this point can help us keep concentration and
focus on one type of need at a time. It also helps us make sure to cover
a wide range of things in our prayers. But only use it if you find it
helpful.

When we are ready to finish, we pray the **closing prayer**. Pray it out
loud or silently, very slowly, pausing between each line to allow the
words to become a reality in your heart.

Now **the conclusion** closes the time of prayer and reminds us of our
dependency on God and His joy at blessing us as His beloved children.

### A Litany

*A litany is a list of topics for prayer. If you think it will help you,
memorise parts or all of this litany to help you pray for yourself and
others. When you use it, recite one paragraph and then pause to allow
prayers to rise from your heart in line with its focus. The Spirit will
bring to your mind specific issues or people to pray for. You can also
use it throughout the day to help you continue praying whenever you
remember. Don't try to use all of it at once! Take it slowly and
gradually memorise more at your own pace.*
