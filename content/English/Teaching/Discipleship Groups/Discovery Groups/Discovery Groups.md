# Discovery Groups

Discovery groups are mixed-sex discipleship groups of up to about 12
people. They are usually formed when reaching out to a new family,
friendship group or community, or by a few Growth Groups meeting
together for mutual encouragement.

Because Growth Groups are limited to no more than 4 people, a Discovery
Group is often more appropriate when reaching *groups* of people rather
than ones and twos.

Once people in a Discovery Group start to commit themselves to Jesus you
should encourage them to form Growth Groups for more effective
discipling and outreach. Meanwhile, the Discovery Group can naturally
transition into a Missional Community.

As with Growth Groups, you should disciple for obedience and mission
from day one, **even if the members are not yet believers**. You will be
amazed at what the Holy Spirit will do if you simply expect the members
to pray and be obedient to scripture from the start. Discovery Groups
have proved to be a very powerful means of introducing the Gospel to new
communities around the world, including very closed Muslim communities.
They are often started by women and should always aim to include whole
families.

They are particularly good when reaching new communities because the
group learns more quickly and collectively remembers more than when
working with an individual. Discovery Groups also provide protection
against error because they are self-correcting (see 5.c below).

## Format for a Discovery Group meeting

1.  Give thanks -- be specific and respond in worship.

2.  Ask for help -- prayer and action for personal practical or
    spiritual needs.

3.  Reach out -- prayer and action for practical or spiritual needs in
    the community.

4.  How has each need or concern moved on since last week?

5.  Bible Discovery:

    a.  Read a passage of scripture (see list below).

    b.  One person re-tells the passage in their own words, as if
        > telling a friend.

    c.  Ask the group, "Was anything important missed out or added?" If
        > anything was added, ask "Where did you get that from in this
        > passage?"

    d.  Ask each person the four discipleship questions:

> What does this tell us about people\'s character or nature?
>
> What does this tell us about Jesus or God?
>
> What does Jesus want to say to me personally?
>
> Who does Jesus want me to share this message with?

6.  When shall we meet again?

7.  When shall we meet the community/individual needs we identified?

Each person should keep a notebook of the spiritual and practical
actions they agree to take.

## Trusting the Holy Spirit

From the very start we must let the Holy Spirit do His work with His
word in His children. This surprising principle has been discovered and
proved time and again by church multiplication movements in every
culture across the world:

-   Do not explain scripture to lost people or early converts!

At the heart of this principal is that we must demonstrate that we allow
scripture to have authority in our lives, not that we are an authority
over scripture. The Holy Spirit has been sent by Jesus to reveal His
glory through Scripture. We must let Him do His work.

Our role is to guide people in their own reading and interpretation of
scripture, which is what Philip did for the eunuch in Acts 8:31 (NIV has
"explains" but most translations have "guide" which is much closer to
the Greek). Helping someone to understand the words of scripture and to
ask the four discipleship questions and answer them for ourselves is as
far as we need to go in a Discovery Group.

Another important point is that if, by the display of our great wisdom,
we make people feel they need an expert in order to understand
scripture, then we prevent multiplication of the group. If every group
feels they need an expert bible teacher then the number of groups
becomes limited to the number of available experts.

## Becoming a Church

Whenever a member of a Discovery Group decides to follow Jesus they
should be baptised by the person who led them to Christ or the leader of
the group. When several members of the group have been baptised -- guess
what? You have a church -- a group of people, some of whom are
believers, meeting in Jesus's name and in His presence. What happens
next is up to you, but we hope you will multiply Growth Groups and
Missional Communities and start new Discovery Groups in other
communities.
