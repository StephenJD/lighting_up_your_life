We had a very fruitful trip building on our previous visits and it looks
like its impact will be massive and far reaching.

Our Liberian partners had asked that we would focus on leadership
training this year, so a typical day went something like this:

> •         Up at dawn with a cool shower under a bucket of well-water,
> followed by a simple breakfast.
>
> •         Out to visit some sick people to pray for healing and
> deliverance.
>
> •         9am - Growth Group training and demonstrations with leaders
> or teachers or school children.
>
> •         Leadership training with our key leaders from the town and
> surrounding villages.
>
> •         Lunch of rice and fish, followed by the second session of
> leadership training.
>
> •         A little rest or more Growth Group training with women and
> children.
>
> •         Late afternoon into the communities to share the Gospel heal
> the sick and demonstrate Growth Groups in people\'s homes.
>
> •         Back late in the evening for a light supper or if not too
> late a final teaching session for the wider community.

Our main focus was to teach and demonstrate Growth Groups as the most
effective means of evangelism and discipling. A Growth Group is two or
three people who meet regularly (usually once or twice a week) to be
discipled by Jesus. Only one of the members needs to be a Christian, the
others may be anyone who is curious about Jesus. When the Growth Group
meets, they start by reading aloud a short passage of scripture. Each
person then repeats the passage in their own words to make sure everyone
understands what they have read. Then each person shares in discussing
these four questions:

> 1.       What does this passage tell us about people?
>
> 2.       What does this passage tell us about Jesus or God?
>
> 3.       What does Jesus want to say to me personally?
>
> 4.       Who does Jesus want me to share this message with?

 

Wherever we demonstrated Growth Groups people responded
enthusiastically. We did so in churches, schools, clinics, police-posts,
people\'s homes, to town-chiefs, under trees, in palaver huts and on a
large farm with all the workers and supervisors.

 

On our outreach, we mostly took people who had never done it before, so
we were coaching and demonstrating how to share the gospel, heal the
sick and demonstrate Growth Groups. Andy and Chris were both brilliant
at the Growth Group training and in coaching people in healing and
outreach. Chris saw a whole string of convincing healings with people
laughing and dancing for joy. Andy was very bold and went in search of
the most seriously sick -- particularly the paralysed. Although we did
not see any paralysed people fully healed, we saw several cases of
significant improvement. Two paralysed people with no sensation in their
legs had their feeling restored. When we started to pray for Momodu he
had no sensation in his legs, could not hold his body upright and could
not talk. When we left him he was holding himself upright, could feel
and move his legs, and was able to answer our questions! We pray for his
continued and complete healing.

It was wonderful to hear Rose, a teenage girl who had never seen a
healing miracle before, testify how she had witnessed an elderly man\'s
leg grow an inch as I held his feet in my hands. He had broken his leg
as a young man and it left him with a short leg. For many decades he had
suffered with a limp and we left him rejoicing in getting his balance
back again.

Not everyone was healed when we prayed, and it grieved us to leave blind
and sick people still with their sickness. But we know from previous
trips that many of those will receive healing over time.

We visited more than a dozen communities, sleeping in five different
homes as we travelled from place to place and were always made very
welcome.

The spiritual change in the area around Ganglata in Lofa county which we
have been visiting for the last few years is really remarkable. In three
years the Gospel has transformed the area from one of darkness, fear,
oppression, evil spirits and curses to one of joyful freedom in Jesus,
faith and hope in God and a desire to walk with Jesus and share the Good
News.

 

The border with Guinea is only half an hour\'s walk from our base in
Ganglata. The people there are hungry for the Gospel. We pray that
Growth Groups will be tested and proved to be really effective in
raising Disciples of Jesus in Ganglata and the surrounding villages, and
that they will raise up many evangelists who can take the Gospel into
Guinea.
