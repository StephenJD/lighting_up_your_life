**Growth Group -- Two or three people listening to Jesus**

**Love one another -- Go and make disciples**

\"Where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them.\" Matthew
18:20

\"The Spirit of truth will guide you into all the truth.\" John 16:13

1\. What does this tell us about people\'s nature?

2\. What does this tell us about Jesus or God?

3\. What does Jesus want to say to me personally?

4\. Who does Jesus want me to share this message with?

**No Preaching allowed!** Take turns to pray for each one in the group,
and for your outreach.
