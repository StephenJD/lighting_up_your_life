## Introduction

The subjects of repentance and righteousness often arouse strong
emotions amongst Christians because they are both foundational doctrines
but also because they touch us deeply; they relate to our deepest needs
of acceptance and self-worth. Leaders often have strong opinions about
the doctrinal aspects because they are trying to deal with church
members whose behaviour is sometimes troublesome. It is important,
therefore, that we examine scripture carefully and try to let it
instruct us, rather than simply try to justify our own beliefs.

In this study we will try to address two fundamental issues:

1.  What and when do we need to confess and repent?

2.  When and how are we made righteous?

## Our Tradition

Repentance has largely gone out of fashion in presenting the Gospel, in
reaction to the puritan preaching of fiery judgement: "Sinners in the
hands of an angry God". It has been replaced by the appeal to God's
love: "If only you knew just how passionately God loves you, you would
come running to His open arms". A person responding to this gospel of
love is then typically encouraged to pray the "sinner's" prayer, asking
for forgiveness for their imperfect character. They are then told that
they are forgiven and now have eternal life.

We are then taught that to continue to be forgiven we need to keep
confessing our sins and asking for forgiveness as often as we are aware
of having sinned -- keep short accounts with God. We are taught that we
are sinners, saved by grace and though we should slowly grow in
righteousness, we will inevitably repeatedly fail in our struggle
against temptation.

## Salvation Repentance

So what do the scriptures teach about repentance for salvation?

> Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God. "The time
> has come," he said. "The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and
> believe the good news!" **Mark 1:15**
>
> Repentance for the forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to
> all nations **Luke 24:47**
>
> Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out
> **Acts 3:19**
>
> "God has granted repentance that leads to life." **Acts 11:18**

We can see from these scriptures that repentance is to be preached as an
integral part of the Gospel and as a pre-requisite for salvation. But
what is not so obvious is the nature of that repentance. Mark's quote
above points us in the right direction. The "good news" Jesus proclaimed
was "The time has come. The kingdom of God has come near." The proper
response to that news is "Repent and believe that the time has come and
the kingdom of God has come near."

Repentance for salvation concerns our belief about the Kingdom; it is
not focussed on our own imperfect nature:

> I am sending you to them to open their eyes and turn them from
> darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, so that they
> may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are
> sanctified by faith in me.' **Acts 26:18**
>
> For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us
> into the kingdom of the Son he loves, in whom we have redemption, the
> forgiveness of sins. **Col 1:13**
>
> But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's
> special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called
> you out of darkness into his wonderful light. Once you were not a
> people, but now you are the people of God; once you had not received
> mercy, but now you have received mercy. **1 Peter 2:9-10**

Repentance, which means to change direction, is about turning from
darkness to light, from the power of Satan to God, from the Kingdom of
darkness to the Kingdom of Jesus, from being "not a people" to becoming
a member of God's people.

This is the biblical language of repentance for salvation. If we talk
instead about lying, cheating, being selfish and unkind, being lustful
or covetous, then we are directing people's focus to their imperfect
character rather than to the kingdom of which they are an unwitting
part.

Telling someone they will one day have to face a judge to answer for
their wrong-doing may be true, but it does not direct a person to the
kind of repentance that is required.

A person does not need to be convicted of their personal sinfulness to
be saved; they need to be convinced that their world-view is wrong. They
are on their life journey, doing their best to make progress towards a
better future. Then one day they meet someone who tells them they are
headed in the wrong direction. If they are convinced, they will be
hugely grateful! They will regret all the time and energy they have
spent heading in the wrong direction and turn round and start heading in
a new direction. Whether they are a great sinner or not is not
particularly relevant.

Repentance for salvation is a change of world-view, a change in our
whole way of thinking. It is much more like changing political
affiliation, or emigrating to another land. Indeed it is a change of
religion -- from our former beliefs to believe that Jesus is
God-become-man to bring us to the righteous and loving Father.

The sinner's prayer, therefore, should not be "I have sinned. Please
forgive me", but "I have been heading in the wrong direction; going
along with the lies and deceit of the kingdom of this world. I want to
turn from all that and follow the light and truth of Jesus, God's Son".

## Salvation Forgiveness

We have seen that salvation repentance is kingdom-sized. In the same
way, forgiveness is kingdom-sized.

> "Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out"
> **Acts 3:19**
>
> "... in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins." **Col
> 1:13**

Salvation forgiveness is not concerned with individual sins, or our
imperfect character, but with sin as a barrier between us and God.
**All** our sins are wiped out; we receive forgiveness for all our sins,
those past and those future. All are forgiven for those who become
children of God.

> "Everyone who believes in Him receives forgiveness of sins" **Acts
> 10:43**
>
> For by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being
> made holy... "Their sins and lawless acts I will remember no more."
> **Heb 10:14,17**
>
> \"In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of
> sins, in accordance with the riches of God\'s grace\" **Ephesians
> 1:7**

Salvation forgiveness is a New-Covenant promise of God. God is no longer
sin-conscious towards those who are born again.

## Fellowship Repentance

Having repented for salvation, been baptised in water and born again by
the Holy Spirit we are forever made righteous; cleansed and forgiven for
our sins. Christ Himself has become our righteousness:

> For by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being
> made holy... "Their sins and lawless acts I will remember no more."
> **Heb 10:14,17**
>
> But by His doing you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from
> God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption. **1 Cor
> 1:30**
>
> He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that we might
> become the righteousness of God in Him. **2 Cor 5:21**

There is nothing more that needs to be done for our sin. Jesus has
already done it all:

> So Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many; and he
> will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to
> those who are waiting for him. **Hebrews 9:28**

If we are totally and forever forgiven as children of God, what is the
place of ongoing repentance and confession for a believer? Teaching
about confession for Christians is often based upon a misunderstanding
of:

> "If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is
> not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will
> forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness." **1 John
> 1:8-9**

In this opening passage of his letter John is talking about the Gospel
he has proclaimed to them; the Gospel through which they were saved; the
Gospel that demands repentance from the kingdom of darkness to the
Kingdom of light (v5-7). Those who deny their need for repentance are
deceived, but those who confess their previous deception are made
righteous (v8-10). Thus 1 John 1:8-9 are about a person responding to
the Gospel and coming to faith; they are not instructions for believers
(see \"If we confess our sins\...\" at the end of this document).
Instructions for believers come in the next chapter:

> "If anybody does sin, we have an advocate with the Father---Jesus
> Christ, the Righteous One. He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins."
> **1 John 2:1**

Here there is no requirement for confession and repentance. We already
have a full-time advocate with the Father whose atoning sacrifice is
forever sufficient. We are not supposed to live with a continuing
reminder of our sin. As believers we live in the wonder of continuing
forgiveness because Jesus' death was sufficient for us. We are now to
live in the joy of knowing that Jesus is our righteousness.

> "Having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our
> Lord Jesus Christ" **Rom 5:1**
>
> For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves
> with Christ. **Gal 3:27**

The Holy Spirits convicts unbelievers of sin, but His work for a
believer is to convict them of their righteousness in Christ:

> Count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus ... You
> have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness.
> **Rom 6:11,18**
>
> And now, little children, abide in Him, that when He appears, we may
> have confidence and not be ashamed before Him at His coming. **1 John
> 2:28**
>
> In Christ you have been brought to fullness. He is the head over every
> power and authority. In him you were also circumcised with a
> circumcision not performed by human hands. Your whole self, ruled by
> the flesh, was put off when you were circumcised by Christ, having
> been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with
> him through your faith in the working of God, who raised him from the
> dead. When you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of
> your flesh, God made you alive with Christ. He forgave us all our
> sins, having cancelled the charge of our legal indebtedness, which
> stood against us and condemned us; he has taken it away, nailing it to
> the cross. **Col 2:10-14**

Our conscience can condemn us even though we know God does not. The
devil is the "Accuser of the brethren" (Rev 12:10). Paul warns us to
guard against the fiery darts of the evil one by wearing the breastplate
of righteousness (Eph 6:14). Whose righteousness do you suppose we wear?
Ours? No! It is Christ's righteousness that we wear. The devil wants us
to be sin-conscious; God wants us to be Christ-conscious:

> Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on
> things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set
> your minds on things above, not on earthly things. For you died, and
> your life is now hidden with Christ in God. When Christ, who is your
> life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory. **Col
> 3:1-4**

Do you feel Teflon-coated clean? All-the-time clean? That your sin and
shortcomings do not and cannot make you dirty or give you a guilty
conscience? That you do not need to confess your sins to God in order to
draw near to him with joy and confidence? It is the work of the Holy
Spirit and our responsibility as disciples to convince ourselves of
these great biblical truths.

We need to know our sins are forgiven as a free gift, with nothing at
all for us to contribute. But in order for us to have a clean conscience
we also need to know that Christ is our righteousness. Our identity is
Christ, not mucky me. My conscience is his conscience, my confidence is
his confidence, my righteousness is his righteousness. We need to know
this, not simply as doctrinal truth, but as a felt reality.

We do not need to confess our sins and ask for forgiveness if we are
born again. If the Holy Spirit is living in us He changes our hearts so
that we do not want to sin. But if we do, "we have an advocate..." John
tells us that when we belong to God and believe His truth, our hearts
will be at rest and not suffer from condemnation:

> This is how we know that we belong to the truth and how we set our
> hearts at rest in his presence: if our hearts condemn us, we know that
> God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything. Dear friends,
> if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before God and
> receive from him anything we ask, because we keep his commands and do
> what pleases him. And this is his command: to believe in the name of
> his Son, Jesus Christ, and to love one another as he commanded us. The
> one who keeps God's commands lives in him, and he in them. And this is
> how we know that he lives in us: we know it by the Spirit he gave us.
> **1 John 3:19-24**

Although we naturally repent when the Holy Spirit does reveal sin to us,
sometimes we become hardened to our sin and it takes some more drastic
action from the Lord to confront us with our folly:

> It is for discipline that you endure; God deals with you as with sons;
> for what son is there whom his father does not discipline? \...but He
> disciplines us for our good, so that we may share His holiness. ...
> afterwards it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness. **Heb
> 12:7-11**
>
> 'Therefore remember from where you have fallen, and repent and do the
> deeds you did at first; or else I am coming to you and will remove
> your lampstand out of its place --- unless you repent. **Rev. 2:5**

Holiness matters because we have turned away from darkness to Light and
we want to walk in the light and truth. We want to enjoy fellowship with
the Holy Spirit and with one another. We will want to talk to God about
the areas where we fall short of God's glory because we will want His
help to grow more like Christ. We are likely to confess our short
comings and thank Him for His grace and forgiveness.

The problem with seeing repentance as a daily requirement for dealing
with sinful acts is that it encourages us to see our relationship with
God as being performance-based. It feeds unbelief, self-righteousness
and tends to make us compare ourselves with others:

> You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? ... Are you so foolish?
> After beginning by means of the Spirit, are you now trying to finish
> by means of the flesh? ... Abraham "believed God, and it was credited
> to him as righteousness." Understand, then, that those who have faith
> are children of Abraham. **Gal 3:1**

Sin consciousness stifles our growth. It hinders our fellowship with
God. It leaves us with a tainted conscience which makes us feel dirty
and unable to approach God with confidence. The boast of the New
Covenant over the Old is that it gives us a clear conscience (at least
it should do!):

> The Old Covenant sacrifices were not able to clear the conscience of
> the worshipper ... How much more, then, will the blood of Christ ...
> cleanse our consciences from dead works so that we may serve the
> living God! ... Let us draw near to God with a sincere heart and with
> the full assurance that faith brings, having our hearts sprinkled to
> cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with
> pure water. **Heb 9:9, 14, 10:22**

## Fellowship Forgiveness

There is a place for repentance, confession and asking for forgiveness:
in our relationships with each other:

> "forgive our sins as we forgive others..." **Matt 6:12**
>
> \"Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one
> another, that you may be healed.\" **James 5:16**

Sin creates barriers and difficulties between believers:

> But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship
> with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us
> from all sin. **1 John 1:7**
>
> "Moreover if your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault
> between you and him alone. If he hears you, you have gained your
> brother. **Matt 18:15**

If we have turned from the kingdom of darkness to the Kingdom of Light,
we will want to walk in light and truth with one another. We will want
to deal with any relationship issues that arise between us and we will
be gracious and merciful in response to the grace and mercy we have
received from Jesus.

> Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just
> as in Christ God forgave you. **Eph 4:32**
>
> Therefore, as God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe
> yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and
> patience. Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you
> has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you.
> **Col 3:12-13**

## Discipleship

Discipleship is about believing God, trusting His promises and living
out the life of confident faith He calls us to. For us to do this, we
need to be far more conscious of Christ in us than sin in us. Constant
reminders of our sin do nothing to help us move in the power of the Holy
Spirit.

Look over the scriptures quoted in this study and ask yourself "What is
the Spirit trying to convince me of?"

We need to fix our eyes on Jesus, His righteousness, His indwelling
presence, His favour, His promises:

> I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with
> power through his Spirit in your inner being, so that Christ may dwell
> in your hearts through faith. And I pray that you, being rooted and
> established in love, may have power, together with all the Lord's holy
> people, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of
> Christ, and to know this love that surpasses knowledge---that you may
> be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God. Now to him who is
> able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to
> his power that is at work within us, to him be glory in the church and
> in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever! Amen.
> **Eph 3:16-21**

## If we confess our sins\...

John\'s use of the word \"we\" in \"If we confess our sins\...\"(1 John
1v9) has led many to think that John is saying that Christians should
confess their sins. But if we follow John\'s argument through, and
notice how he uses \"we\" then we can see he must be talking about
unbelievers coming to faith.

From vv1-5 John clearly means himself and his fellow apostles when he
uses \"we\". But in v6 he writes:

> \"If we claim to have fellowship with him and yet walk in the
> darkness, we lie and do not live out the truth.\"

Here, John cannot possibly be meaning himself when he writes \"we\". He
is using \"we\" to imagine himself in the shoes of an unbeliever. In v7
he continues to imagine himself as that unbeliever coming into the light
of the Gospel:

> \"But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have
> fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies
> us from all sin.\"

In v8 and v10 it is again clear that he uses \"we\" to imagine an
unbeliever, but this time one who rejects the light:

> \"If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is
> not in us.\" \... \"If we claim we have not sinned, we make him out to
> be a liar and his word is not in us.\"

So that leaves us with the \"we\" in v9:

> \"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us
> our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.\"

Who is John meaning by \"we\"? Well, in both the preceding and following
sentences he clearly means an unbeliever who has encountered the Gospel
of Light -- one who either accepts or rejects the message. It makes no
sense at all for John to suddenly be talking about Christians at this
point. It is obviously the same people he has in mind since v6:
unbelievers encountering the Gospel who either reject the idea that they
are sinners in need of forgiveness, or who confess their need to Jesus
and turn to Him for saving forgiveness. V9 is about what happens when an
unbeliever comes out of darkness into the light. Chapter 2 is about
living as a believer. There, the answer to our ongoing sin is the
eternal advocacy and sufficiency of Jesus - see especially 2:1-2 and
2:12.

So, in conclusion, this famous passage in John\'s letter is NOT an
instruction to believers to keep confessing their sin, but an
instruction to unbelievers coming to faith. God does not want us to keep
remembering our sin. He has forgiven it. He wants us to remember and
celebrate Christ who is our righteousness -- \"Set your minds on things
above, not on things below\" Colossians 3:1-3.
