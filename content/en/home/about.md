Life for Liberia is a partnership between Christians in the UK and Christians in Liberia. It started with a friendship between Stephen Dolley, now living in Chinley in the High Peak district of Derbyshire, UK, and Jonathan Nathan who lives in Monrovia Liberia. We met "by chance" whilst both visiting Ghana some years ago. We kept in touch and the relationship has developed naturally from there.

 

Through Jonathan we have been introduced to other pastors and communities where we seek to encourage simple faith in the living Jesus Christ as we share the Gospel of God's grace.
