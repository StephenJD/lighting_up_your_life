The word "Gospel" means "Good News".

We only have to turn on the TV to see that our world is broken. And we only have to look honestly within ourselves to see why the world is broken: it is because we are broken inside. The good news that the Bible Gospels tell us is encapsulated in four words:

**Freedom**: God wants to break the power of evil over our lives and set us free to know His love for us.

**Jesus**: He sent His Son Jesus to show us the way and make this possible.

**Repentance**: He invites you to turn your life around from trying to manage it your own way, and instead put your trust completely in Him.

**Baptism**: If you want to make this complete change in your life, you must "die" to what you have been and let God give you His new life. This is the meaning of baptism...
